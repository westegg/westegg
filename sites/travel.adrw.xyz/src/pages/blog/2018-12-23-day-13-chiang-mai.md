  The shadows of the women weaving new cloth bounced across the floors, the
  different colours of thread moving in and around each other becoming a
  masterpiece to add to the wall of blankets and scarves.

Taking over 2 months to weave, the Thai blanket was made in a small village comprising of Catholic refugees from Cambodia and Laos allowed in to Thailand decades ago.

Friendly dogs and puppies and children played in the street, there was joy in the quiet bustle of the sleepy village.

We’re looking forward to appreciating their craftsmanship and the memories of our trip with the blanket in our home.
