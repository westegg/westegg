  Bustling with activity, we tried street food and took in our first morning in
  Bangkok.

We awoke to the sound of bird calls and bustling people awaking to a new day.

The alley that was so quiet and dark last night when we tried to find our Airbnb was now alive with the bustle of motorcycles, tuktuks, street food vendors, small shops, kids walking to school, and even industrial production. We passed a printing press company, mechanics, welders, paint stores, producing smells and sounds of every kind.

We tried some satay (street meat kebab) and sat down at a corner across from the bank for our first local soup. The corner street food place seemed to be a favourite with local motorcycle taxi drivers. If the locals trust it, we could too!
