## Ambitious Intentions

We had a long list of attractions we hoped to see:

- Batu Caves
- KLCC Park (by Petronas Towers)
- National Museum
- Butterfly Park
- Central Market
- Merdeka Square
- National Textile Museum

And some local food scenes:

- Jalan Alor
- Hutong Lot 10: Ho Weng Kee’s wantan mee, Soong Kee’s beef noodles and Chua Brothers’s char kway teow
- Tapak Urban Street Dining: food trucks near KLCC and golden triangle
- Petaling Street Market (Chinatown): Sze Ngan Chye Salted Roast Duck, Madam Tang Mua Chi Stall, Hon Kee Porridge and Koon Kee Wantan Mee
- Sambal Hijau

...but the city was far too big to see even a quarter of them.

## Batu Caves

As we approached the colourful steps leading up into the caves, we walked through a square teeming with monkeys. Some tourists would try to feed the monkeys, but often have the bag of nuts ripped from their hands or the monkeys pawing them if there was no more food.

The 272 steps led up past the big golden statue into the limestone caves, behind us a beautiful panorama of the sprawling city of Kuala Lampur.

The caves arched over 300 feet to the top with some holes in the roof letting in the the lush vegetation above.
